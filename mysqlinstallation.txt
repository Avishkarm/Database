MySQL is the world’s most popular open source database, enabling the cost-effective delivery of reliable, high-performance and scalable Web-based and embedded database applications. It is an integrated transaction safe, ACID-compliant database with full commit, rollback, crash recovery, and row-level locking capabilities. MySQL delivers the ease of use, scalability, and high performance, as well as a full suit of database drivers and visual tools to help developers and DBAs build and manage their business-critical MySQL applications.
MySQL is a central component of the LAMP open-source web application software stack (and other "AMP" stacks). LAMP is an acronym for "Linux, Apache, MySQL, Perl/PHP/Python". Applications that use the MySQL database include: TYPO3, MODx, Joomla, WordPress, phpBB, MyBB, and Drupal. MySQL is also used in many high-profile, large-scale websites.

MySQL Installation:
-------------------

sudo apt-get update

sudo apt-get install mysql-server 

Configuring MySQL:
-----------------
First, you’ll want to run the included security script. This changes some of the less secure default options for things like remote root logins and sample users.

You’ll be prompt to enter your current password. Enter the root MySQL password set during installation:

Enter current password for root (enter for none):

Then, assuming you set a strong root password, go ahead and enter nat the following prompt:

Change the root password? [Y/n] n

Remove anonymous users, Y:

Remove anonymous users? [Y/n] Y

Disallow root logins remotely, Y:

Disallow root login remotely? [Y/n] Y

Remove test database and access to it, Y:

Remove test database and access to it? [Y/n] Y

And reload privilege tables, Y:

Reload privilege tables now? [Y/n] Y


sudo mysql_secure_installation

mysqladmin -p -u root version


MySQL Commands

MySQL should start running automatically after installation. To test this, check its status.
service mysql status

If MySQL isn’t running, you can start it with the following command
sudo service mysql start

Allow Remote Connections:
------------------------
Commenting the binding_address in the my.cnf file and restarting the mysql server

sudo /etc/mysql/nano my.cnf

Replace bind-address = 127.0.0.1 with:
bind-address = 0.0.0.0

Restart sudo service mysql restart

Allow particular host to connect:
---------------------------------

To know Public IP address of m/c: 
dig TXT +short o-o.myaddr.l.google.com @ns1.google.com | awk -F'"' '{ print $2}'

To check root has access from hosts/IPs other than localhost.

mysql> use mysql;
mysql> SELECT host FROM user WHERE user = 'root';

GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO root@‘ip address’ IDENTIFIED BY ‘password’ WITH GRANT OPTION;


FLUSH PRIVILEGES;


Import database:
----------------


mysql -u root -p dbname < dbdmup.sql
